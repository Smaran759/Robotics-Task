FOR PROGRAMMING TASKS:

This is a Cpp Code(Arduino.cpp) to be ran in an Arduino Board to blink a LED connected in series with a Slide Switch
The program starts with assigning the LED the Digital Pin No. 8 on the board. 
The choice was specifically made as any analog pin may only give binary voltage signal(i.e. HIGH or LOW) but the digital pins allow us to adjust the brightness of the LED(using integers between 0 and 255).
The pin was set to appropriate modes give out suitable OUTPUT.
The Looped part of the Code Blinks the LED at the delayed hardcoded into the code but can be changed by accessing the code itself
The LED blinks when the circuit is completed by Slide Switch
A video file is shown of the above working in TinkerCAD

Also includes a Programming Research.pdf to share what I understood about OpenCV Library and YOLO Algorithm

FOR MECHANICS TASK:
Includes a Txt file(Pinion Link.txt) along with a screenshot of the gear(Pinion gear screenshot.png) just in case the file doesnt run properly

FOR ELECTRONICS TASK:
Programming Research.pdf to shortly describe all 6 questions in the Research part of Electronics Task
